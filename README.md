# breast-cancer-prediction
Machine Learning project to predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant using SVC, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and KNN.
# 🧠 Breast Cancer Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This is my first complete Machine Learning project! 🎉  
The goal of the project is to predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer dataset from scikit-learn.

I implemented four classification algorithms within a Pipeline to organize the workflow and make the process efficient and scalable:

- 🟢 Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- 🟢 Logistic Regression
- 🟢 Random Forest Classifier
- 🟢 K-Neighbors Classifier

## 🚀 Project Workflow
1. Data Loading → Load the Breast Cancer dataset from scikit-learn.
2. Data Preprocessing → Clean and prepare the dataset for training.
3. Model Training → Train models using four classification algorithms.
4. Evaluation → Compare model performance and validate predictions.
